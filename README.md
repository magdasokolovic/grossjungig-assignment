It was great talking to you, and I am glad to have you in this process. As part of the technical assessment, please complete the following assignment latest by 20th October.

Your task is to develop a simple single-page static personal website of yourself using React. Since you are interested in working with styled-components, you can use that for styling the components. The website should contain a Navbar and a Footer, with some elements on both (no need to add any link or functionality) and the main page should contain an image, either graphics or a photo, and a heading and a small description. (I was talking about a different assignment during the interview, but forget that, you can just do this one)

There is no need to deploy it anywhere. Upload the code to github.com and send me the link.

Evaluation criteria:-

1. Responsiveness of the site
2. Coding best practices
