# My task:

Your task is to develop a simple single-page static personal website of yourself using React. Since you are interested in working with styled-components, you can use that for styling the components. The website should contain a Navbar and a Footer, with some elements on both (no need to add any link or functionality) and the main page should contain an image, either graphics or a photo, and a heading and a small description. 

There is no need to deploy it anywhere. Upload the code to github.com and send me the link.

Evaluation criteria:-

1. Responsiveness of the site
2. Coding best practices
